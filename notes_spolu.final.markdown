## Intro

- Present myself & Damien in charge of Growth & product at Nitrogram
- Nitrogram presentation


## Quotes

- These are all great quotes about product development 
- Great way to grasp what product dev is
- Read them

## Product Development in Literature

- Tools of successful development
- The only thing is that they suppose you have resources!

## Reality of your startup

- But your startup...

## How we'll cover product Dev

- INSTEAD of describing theoretical techniques for Product Dev
- We'll describe what we did right and did wrong

- We'll use these 4 prisms to look at product development

- Because we believe Product Development
- Is about feedback: you get and how you get it
- Is about team: Team process (how we handle the feedback and communicate the insights)
- Is about focus: Saying yes to a few things and no to a bunch of others
- Practical: Is about the tools you use

## Launch 

- Teleportd Pitch
- We just got Seedcamp
- We had no clue what we were doing
- We though they had an idea of what we where doing... but we later learned that they hadn't either.
- So basically no one had an idea of what we were doing!

## Building Teleportd

#### Feedback

- Your x 100s Testflight users are no usage. 
- They're biased
- If they use, that probably mean they over care and you should probably not listen.
- (-) We probably relied to much on Testflight Early on
- (-) We did not ask users to use the product in front of us

#### Team

- Clear objectives

#### Focus

- MVP is not about quality, it's aboult focusing on one thing
- DO NOT Think your customer will need what you think they will need (you're 3 years in advance)
- One feature, one use case

## Release Teleportd

## Improving Teleportd

#### Feedback

- Casual use / Just checking out
- No traction => usage biased => Won't help the ones who need to be convinced
- (-) We digged our numbers: Dangerous!
- (-) We added a feature based on usage after 2 month -> Means we hadn't traction
- At 2 months, You should be extinguishing fires

#### Team

- Communication not centered on product until we realize no traction
- Then it's all about Feedback

#### Focus

- If fail, go to your next experiment
- Otherwise start building on this core product

## Pivot

- Feedback did not serve the product
- But meeting with people was useful

## Teleportd API & Capsules

#### Feedback

- Back to step 0
- B2B feedback loops are way longer!
- 2 new Employees = 2 new PoVs

#### Team

- Tech focused. Communication easy but...
- Cus Dev is lacking (long loops)
- Very dangerous for focus

#### Focus

- We built WAY too much


## Focus Pivot

- Too many features, no real customer traction
- First thing we needed was money! We raised $1m on the Vision
- Asked ourselves THE question

## Nitrogram v0

#### Feedback

- After Focus pivot -> One feature -> Can you charge more???

#### Team

- We worked on 2 products at the same time. Don't do that!
- Product Split Brain

#### Focus

- Focus is clear. Strip down to one feature
- Make it look good and release early as experiment 
- Product was slow and failed - Needed to scale up!

##  100% Team on Nitrogram

- We ditched Capsules after a few months 
- And focused the whole team on Nitrogram

## Nitrogram v1

#### Feedback

- Feedback was what was going on on v0

#### Team

- Biz sells v0 and Tech builds v1
- Version split brain
- Communication is key. Biz did not know what was v1
- Had a hard time pre-selling it or testing assumption / Low visibilty

#### Focus

- Invested time on proper backend and design
- Specification was quite easy thanks to v0
