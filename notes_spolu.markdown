### EVENT: GET STARTED


>>>GET STARTED<<< (No customer discovery generally happen here, that's probably ok)
- Teleportd Pitch
- We just got Seedcamp
- We had no clue what we were doing
- We though they had an idea of what we where doing... but we later learned that they hadn't either.
- So basically no one had an idea of what we were doing!

- **Building Teleportd App [B2C]** [3 months]
> 2 founders
- [TEAM] No customer, No usage + clear Objectives = No problem
- [FEEDBACK] Your x 100s Testflight users are no usage. 
 * They're biased
 * They probably don't care so they won't use a half baked product
 * If they use, that probably mean they over care and you should probably not listen.
 [-] rely too much on testfligh
 [-] Not asking a few users to use the product in front of us
 [+] Test with small chunk of people. Test with them. 
- [FOCUS] Keep it absolutely simple.
 * It's not about the quality (MVP) it's about focusing on one thing only
 * You can still "micro"-pivot and focus on another right after
 [-] Not focusing on ONE feature but many
 [-] Think your customer will need what you think they will need (you're 3 years in advance)
 [+] Gantify your product dev. Focus on one experiment, one use case, one feature.
 [+] Better to have 1 good feature than a multi-headed shitty MVP

>>>RELEASE TELEPORTD<<<
- Coverage on TNW [http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/10/10/teleportd-lets-you-search-photos-shared-on-twitter-instagram-and-more-in-real-time/]
- Coverage by Scobleize [https://plus.google.com/+Scobleizer/posts/1TunJDKGz3T]

- **Improving Teleportd App [B2C]**
> 2 founders / 2 months
- [TEAM]
  [-] Communication not centered on the product anymore until we realize no traction
  [-] Then it's all about the product and looking for feedback
- [FEEDBACK] No real traction no real feedback.
  * Casual Use / Just checking out
  * We had to dig our usage numbers -> Very Dangerous
  * No traction => Usage is biased => You won't help the ones you need to convince
  * If you already add a feature based on usage 2 months in that means you don't have enough "traction"
  * 2 months in you should extinguish fires and build what you purposely did not before
- [FOCUS]
  * Go to your next experiment if fail. Otherwise start building on this core product.

>>>PIVOT<<< (Some customer discovery is supposed to happen here)

- **Teleportd API & Capsules [B2B]** 
> 2 founders + 2 tech employees
- [TEAM] Back to the drawing board. 
  * Communication easy as whole activity is tech focused again
- [FEEDBACK]
  * Back to step 0
  * You have 2 very early & engaged user who bring new PoV
  * B2B means you can extract even more value from test with customers
- [FOCUS]
  * Same as before
  * All cycles shall be consumed + longer B2B feedback loops
  [-] We built wAY too much

>>>FEATURES LIMBO<<< (Too many features, few $s, few users)
  [+] Solution: Raise $1m (how?) [B2B: never release a product, B2C: ?]
  [+] Solution: *How would I feel if a new startup was to launch with subset X of my features for subset Y of my customers* [Target audience is a incr f() of features]

>>>FOCUS PIVOT<<<

- **Nitrogram v0 [B2B]**
> 2 founders + 2 tech employees + 1 biz + 1 content
- [FOCUS]
  [+] We though for a long time and decided to go for only analytics.
- [TEAM] Complicated we run two products for 2 months
  - Communication was a mess
  [-] Don't do that
  [+] We did it only for 2 months
  - If you really need to do it, focus some people on product 1 and some other on product 2
- [FEEDBACK] We built only one feature
  * After a focus pivot your main feedback will be whether you can charge people you could not before
  * You target less people and you should sell more

- **Building Nitrogram v1 [B2B]**
> 2 founders + 2 tech employees + 1 biz + 1 content
- [TEAM]
  - Team fully focused on Nitrogram. Biz selling v0, Tech building v1
  [-] Biz ended up not having any idea of what tech was doing
  [-] Weird split-brain configuration
  [+] Daily email from tech to explain what was going on (example email)
- [FEEDBACK]  
  - v0 was our source of feedback and we needed a new independent version since everything needed rebuild
  - We were mainly reshaping for scale so no real need of feedback
  [+] When you start selling, you get a surge of feedback through request.
  [-] Not all feedback is good. They probably won't pay for it ~ Customer Discovery
- [FOCUS]
  - We were making first $ and needed to reshape for scale 
  [+] invested time to come up with a new design
  [+] invested in a new techno (angularJS)
  [-] Still, we added galleries without really thinking about it

>>>FOCUS<<<

- **Focusing Nitrogram v1 [B2B]**
> 2 founders + 2 tech employees + 2 biz + 1 Content + 1 Product
Spent 2 days in Berlin to think about what our customers really needed 
- [TEAM]
  [+] Everyone get some time to think and speak out
- [FEEDBACK]
  [-] No realtime feedback so it's a lot of assumptions
- [FOCUS]
  [+] Decided we would kill the galleries and focus on high end analytics on Instagram only

>>>SOME FORM OF PRODUCT / MARKET FIT<<< $1k -> $20k in a few months

- **Optimizing Nitrogram v1 [B2B]**
> 2 founders + 2 tech employees + 2 biz + 1 Content + 1 Product
